Argon::Simple

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Argon::Simple;

    connect 'somehost:9999';

    my $deferred = process { shift * 2 } 21;
    if ($deferred->() == 42) {
        print "So long, and thanks for all the fish!\n";
    }

    my ($deferred, $is_finished) = process { shift * 2 } 21;
    do { print "." } until $is_finished->();
    print "So long, and thanks for all the fish!\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In most cases, a script or application is going to connect to a single Argon
system. For these cases, this module provides simplified access to the Argon
system.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 connect("host:port")

Connects to a single Argon manager. If called with a single argument, a string
in the form of "host:port" is expected. Alternately, the host and port may be
passed as two separate arguments (e.g. C<connect($host, $port)>).

=head2 process { code } @args

When called in scalar context, returns a CODE reference. When called, the
C<Coro> thread will block (cede) until the result is retrieved from the Argon
system and is available.

When called in list context, additionally returns a CODE reference which
evaluates to true when the task has been completed by the Argon system.

See also L<Coro::ProcessPool/A NOTE ABOUT IMPORTS AND CLOSURES>, which has
some important information about C<use> and C<require>.

=head2 task 'Task::Class', @args

Similar to process, but passes in the name of a class implementing the methods
C<new(@args)> and C<run>. The result of C<run> is returned. Note that the class
must be found on the workers' include paths.
